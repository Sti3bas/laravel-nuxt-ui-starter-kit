# Laravel + Nuxt UI Starter Kit

## Introduction

Nuxt UI starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Vue frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Vue applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Vue combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Vue starter kit utilizes Vue 3 and the Composition API, TypeScript, and the [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) component library.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This starter kit currently uses Nuxt UI Pro, which is free to use in development but requires a commercial license when deploying to production.
>
> NuxtLabs has [announced](https://nuxtlabs.com/) that it has been acquired by Vercel and that, in **September 2025**, it will release **Nuxt UI v4** â€” a free, open-source library that unifies Nuxt UI and Nuxt UI Pro. Once v4 is released, this starter kit will be updated to use it, removing the need for a Nuxt UI Pro license in production.
